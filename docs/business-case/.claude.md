# Claude AI Instructions - Business Case Documentation

## Context

You are working in the **business case documentation** domain of the VegyScan project. This directory contains strategic market validation and business viability artifacts that form the foundation for product development.

## Directory Purpose

`/docs/business-case/` contains **pre-project strategic groundwork**:
- Market opportunity validation
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Feasibility assessment
- Business model definition
- Go-to-market planning
- Financial viability projections

**This is NOT the same as `/docs/business/`:**
- `/docs/business-case/` = **Strategic layer** (Is there a market? Can we compete? Is it viable?)
- `/docs/business/` = **Product layer** (What should we build? For whom? What features?)

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Analysis
- All claims must be supported by data, research, or credible sources
- Cite sources for market data, statistics, and competitive intelligence
- Distinguish between assumptions and validated facts
- Update documents as new data becomes available

### 2. Strategic Alignment
- Business case artifacts inform product decisions in `/docs/business/`
- Market segments identified here should align with personas
- Competitive differentiation should inform product requirements
- Financial projections should align with vision success metrics

### 3. Template-First Approach
- Each artifact includes a research framework section
- Templates guide what data to collect before analysis
- Maintain the template structure even when completed
- Use checklists to track research progress

### 4. Single Source of Truth
- Business case documents are authoritative for strategic business analysis
- Product documents reference (not duplicate) market/competitive insights
- Financial projections here are the source of truth for ROI discussions

## Document Standards

### File Structure
Each business case document should follow this structure:

```markdown

[What questions need to be answered]

## Data Collection Checklist
- [ ] Data point 1
- [ ] Data point 2
[Specific items to research]

## Analysis
[Structured sections for findings]

## Key Findings
[Bullet-point summary of insights]

## Recommendations
[Actionable next steps]

## Sources
[References and citations]

---
**Status:** [Template/Draft/Complete]
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewed By:** [Name/Role]
```

### Status Indicators
Use consistent status markers in README.md:
- 🔄 Template = Structure created, awaiting research
- 📝 Draft = Work in progress with partial data
- ✅ Complete = Reviewed and approved
- 🔄 Needs Update = Outdated data requiring refresh

## Working with Business Case Artifacts

### Market Analysis
**Focus:** Quantitative market opportunity assessment
- Use TAM/SAM/SOM framework for market sizing
- Include both top-down and bottom-up market estimates
- Identify trends with supporting data (CAGR, growth drivers)
- Segment markets by demographics, psychographics, behavior
- Link market segments to personas in `/docs/business/personas.md`

### Competitor Analysis
**Focus:** Strategic competitive intelligence
- Cover both direct competitors (menu scanning apps) and indirect (manual translation, dietary apps)
- Use structured frameworks (SWOT, competitive matrix)
- Identify white space opportunities for differentiation
- Map competitors to market segments
- Inform product positioning and unique value proposition

### Feasibility Study
**Focus:** Risk assessment across technical, operational, legal, economic dimensions
- Technical feasibility: Can we build this with available technology?
- Operational feasibility: Can we operate/maintain it?
- Legal feasibility: Are there regulatory/compliance issues?
- Economic feasibility: Can we afford to build and run it?
- Timeline feasibility: Can we launch in a reasonable timeframe?

### Business Model
**Focus:** Value creation and capture mechanisms
- Use Business Model Canvas or similar framework
- Define all revenue streams (freemium, subscriptions, ads, partnerships)
- Map cost structure (development, operations, marketing, support)
- Identify key resources, partnerships, and activities
- Define pricing strategy with rationale
- This should align with financial projections

### Go-to-Market Strategy
**Focus:** Customer acquisition and growth plan
- Define target customer segments (link to personas)
- Identify acquisition channels (organic, paid, partnerships, viral)
- Plan launch phases (MVP, beta, public launch, scale)
- Set customer acquisition cost (CAC) targets
- Define activation and retention strategies
- Include content/community strategies if relevant

### Financial Projections
**Focus:** Quantitative business viability model
- Project 1-3 year timeframe
- Include development costs, operational costs, marketing costs
- Model revenue across different scenarios (conservative, realistic, optimistic)
- Calculate key metrics: CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, burn rate, runway
- Determine break-even point
- Calculate ROI and payback period
- Link to success metrics in `/docs/business/vision.md`

## Cross-Document References

### Linking to Product Documents
When business case analysis informs product decisions:

```markdown
**Implication for Product:**
See [User Personas](../business/personas.md#persona-name) - This market segment aligns with [persona]
See [Product Vision](../business/vision.md#target-audience) - Update target audience based on market analysis
See [Requirements](../business/requirements/functional.md) - Feature X addresses competitive gap identified in competitor analysis
```

### Linking from Product Documents
Product documents should reference business case findings:

```markdown
**Market Validation:**
See [Market Analysis](../business-case/market-analysis.md#market-size) for addressable market sizing
See [Competitor Analysis](../business-case/competitor-analysis.md#gaps) for competitive differentiation rationale
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Use data and evidence to support all claims
✅ Cite sources with dates (market data becomes stale)
✅ Distinguish between assumptions and validated facts
✅ Update documents when new competitive intelligence emerges
✅ Link market segments to personas
✅ Align financial projections with vision success metrics
✅ Use visual aids (charts, tables, matrices) for clarity
✅ Include both quantitative data and qualitative insights
✅ Consider multiple scenarios in projections (best/worst/likely)

### DON'T:
❌ Copy strategic analysis into product documents (link instead)
❌ Make unsupported claims about market size or competition
❌ Ignore indirect competitors or substitute products
❌ Create overly optimistic financial projections without rationale
❌ Forget to date market research (it expires)
❌ Duplicate business model information in multiple places
❌ Skip feasibility assessment in favor of wishful thinking
❌ Create business case documents after building the product (these should come first)

## Research Sources

### Market Data
- Industry reports (Statista, Gartner, Forrester)
- Government statistics (census, health departments)
- Academic research papers
- Industry associations
- Surveys and primary research

### Competitive Intelligence
- Competitor websites and app stores
- User reviews and ratings
- Industry news and press releases
- Product Hunt, AppAnnie, SimilarWeb
- Social media and community discussions

### Financial Benchmarks
- Industry financial benchmarks
- Startup metrics (SaaS benchmarks, mobile app economics)
- Public company filings (for comparable businesses)
- VC/accelerator resources (500 Startups, YC, a16z metrics)

## Review and Updates

### When to Update
- Quarterly review of market data and competitive landscape
- When major competitor launches or pivots
- When new market research becomes available
- Before major product decisions or funding discussions
- After completing beta/MVP to validate assumptions

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Are market statistics still current (< 1 year old)?
- [ ] Have new competitors entered the market?
- [ ] Have our assumptions been validated or refuted?
- [ ] Do financial projections align with actual performance?
- [ ] Are go-to-market strategies effective based on data?

## Decision Tracking

When business case analysis leads to strategic decisions:

1. Document the decision in [`/docs/decisions/decision-log.md`](../decisions/decision-log.md)
2. Reference the business case artifact that informed it
3. Update product documents (vision, requirements) accordingly
4. Link back from the business case document to show impact

**Example:**
```markdown
## Decision Impact
This feasibility study led to [Decision LOG-042](../decisions/decision-log.md#LOG-042) to use cloud-based OCR rather than on-device processing due to accuracy requirements and cost constraints.
```
