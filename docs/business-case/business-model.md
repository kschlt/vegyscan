```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate
```

**Inputs:**
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $[X]/month
- Gross Margin: [Y]%
- Monthly Churn Rate: [Z]%

**Calculation:**
```
LTV = ($[X] × [Y]%) / [Z]%
    = $[RESULT]
```

**LTV Estimate:** $[X]

**Sensitivity:**
- If churn reduced by 50%: LTV = $[X] ([Y]% increase)
- If ARPU increased by 20%: LTV = $[X] ([Y]% increase)

---

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Formula:**
```
CAC = Total Marketing & Sales Costs / New Customers Acquired
```

**Marketing & Sales Costs (Monthly):**

---

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Calculation:**
```
LTV:CAC Ratio = $[LTV] / $[CAC]
            = [RATIO]:1
```

**Assessment:**
- **< 1:1** = Losing money on each customer ❌
- **1:1 - 3:1** = Marginal, needs improvement ⚠️
- **3:1 - 5:1** = Healthy unit economics ✅
- **> 5:1** = Great economics or under-investing in growth ✅

**VegyScan LTV:CAC:** [X]:1

**Status:** ❌ Unprofitable / ⚠️ Needs Improvement / ✅ Healthy

**Improvement Strategies:**
- To increase LTV: [Reduce churn, increase ARPU, extend lifetime]
- To decrease CAC: [Optimize channels, improve conversion, viral growth]

---

### Payback Period

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)
```

**Calculation:**
```
Payback Period = $[CAC] / ($[ARPU]/month × [GM]%)
               = [X] months
```

**Payback Period:** [X] months

**Assessment:**
- **< 12 months:** Excellent (can grow quickly) ✅
- **12-18 months:** Good (standard for SaaS) ✅
- **18-24 months:** Acceptable (requires more capital) ⚠️
