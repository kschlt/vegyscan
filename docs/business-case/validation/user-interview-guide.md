## Pre-Interview: Screener Questions

**Send these via email/message BEFORE scheduling to qualify participants:**

1. "Are you vegan, vegetarian, or have dietary restrictions?" (Qualify)
2. "Have you traveled internationally in the past 2 years?" (Qualify - need recent experience)
3. "When you travel, do you eat at restaurants with menus in foreign languages?" (Qualify)
4. "What smartphone do you use?" (iOS / Android / Other) - Note: Not disqualifying, just useful

**Ideal candidates:** Vegan or vegetarian, traveled abroad 1+ times in past 2 years, ate at foreign restaurants

---

## Part 1: Introduction & Context Setting (5 min)

**Start with rapport building, not interrogation:**

"Hi [Name]! Thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm researching how vegan and vegetarian travelers handle food and menus when abroad. I'm just trying to understand your real experiences - there are no right or wrong answers, and I'm genuinely curious about how you navigate this."

**Consent:**
"I'd like to record this conversation so I can focus on our discussion instead of taking notes. Is that okay with you? The recording is just for my research and won't be shared."

**Set expectations:**
"This should take about 30-40 minutes. I'll ask about your travel experiences, how you currently figure out what to order, and I'll describe some app concepts to get your reaction. Sound good?"

---

## Part 2: Travel Context & Background (5 min)

**Goal:** Understand their travel patterns and dietary motivations

**Questions (conversational, not rigid):**

1. **"Tell me about your dietary choice - are you vegan, vegetarian, or something else?"**
   - Listen for: Ethical vs health vs environmental reasons
   - Follow-up: "How strict are you?" (Helps gauge trust/verification needs)

2. **"Where have you traveled recently? Which countries?"**
   - Listen for: Regions (Asia, Europe, Latin America) - different challenges
   - Follow-up: "Which trip was most challenging food-wise?"

3. **"How often do you travel internationally?"**
   - Listen for: Frequency (1-2x year vs frequent traveler) - impacts pricing model preference
   - Note: Seasonal usage pattern?

---

## Part 3: Current Process Deep Dive (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Understand their ACTUAL workflow in detail, not assumptions

**Opening:**
"I want to understand exactly how you handle menus when you're abroad. Walk me through your most recent trip - let's say you're sitting at a restaurant, they hand you a menu in [language]. What happens next?"

**Let them tell their story, then probe:**

4. **"What's the first thing you do when you get a menu you can't read?"**
   - Listen for: Google Translate? Ask waiter? HappyCow check? Guess?
   - Follow-up: "How does that usually work out?"

5. **"What apps or tools do you use? Walk me through your process."**
   - Listen for: Multi-tool workflow (Google Translate + HappyCow + Reddit)
   - Probe each tool: "Why do you use [tool]? What does it help with?"
   - Probe gaps: "What does [tool] NOT help with?"

6. **"How long does this usually take - from getting the menu to actually ordering?"**
   - Listen for: Time pressure, social awkwardness
   - Follow-up: "How does that feel when you're with friends or family?"

7. **"How confident are you that what you ordered is actually vegan/vegetarian when it arrives?"**
   - Listen for: Trust anxiety, verification behavior
   - Follow-up: "Have you ever been surprised or had something wrong?"

8. **[If they mention a negative experience] "Tell me more about that - what happened?"**
   - Listen for: Hidden ingredients (fish sauce, Dashi, lard), miscommunication
   - Emotional response: Anger, guilt, distress?

---

## Part 4: Pain Point Validation (10 min)

**Goal:** Validate specific pain points from research, but don't lead them

**Probe specific scenarios - listen for whether THEY experience these:**

9. **"Have you ever worried about hidden ingredients that might not be obvious? Like fish sauce in vegetable dishes, or lard in beans?"**
   - If YES: "Tell me about that - which ingredients worry you most?"
   - If NO: "So that's not really a concern for you?" (Validate if pain point doesn't apply)
   - Listen for: Cuisine-specific concerns (Asia = fish sauce, Latin America = lard)

10. **"When you use Google Translate or other translation tools, do you feel like you understand what the dish actually IS, or just what the words mean?"**
    - Listen for: Translation vs cultural understanding gap
    - Follow-up: "Can you give me an example where translation wasn't enough?"

11. **"Do you ever feel anxious or stressed about ordering food when traveling?"**
    - Listen for: Trust anxiety, constant vigilance, exhaustion
    - If YES: "What specifically makes you anxious?"
    - If NO: "So it's pretty relaxed for you?" (Good to know!)

12. **"Have you ever avoided ordering something because you couldn't figure out if it was safe?"**
    - Listen for: Limited food options, playing it safe (fries, plain rice)
    - Follow-up: "How often does that happen?"

13. **"Do you ever wish there was something that could help with this? What would that look like in your ideal world?"**
    - Listen for: What they WISH existed (may reveal features we haven't thought of)
    - Don't pitch yet - just listen

---

## Part 5: Feature Concept Testing (10-15 min)

**Goal:** Describe features, gauge genuine excitement vs politeness

**Setup:**
"I want to describe a few ideas for an app and get your honest reaction. Don't worry about being polite - I need to know what would actually help you versus what sounds nice but you wouldn't use."

**Concept 1: Basic Menu Scanning + Translation + Dietary Rating**

"Imagine an app where you take a photo of a foreign menu, and within 2 seconds you get:
- The menu translated to English
- Each dish marked as vegan, vegetarian, or contains meat
- Listed in the same layout as the original menu

What's your reaction to that?"

- **Probe:** "Would you use that? Why or why not?"
- **Probe:** "How is that different from Google Translate + asking the waiter?"
- **Listen for:** Genuine interest vs "yeah that's nice I guess"

---

**Concept 2: Cultural Intelligence / Hidden Ingredients**

"Now imagine the app ALSO knows about hidden ingredients by cuisine. So if you scan a Thai menu, it automatically warns you: 'Pad Thai often contains fish sauce even if not listed' or for Japanese: 'Miso soup typically made with Dashi (fish stock).'

Does that add value for you? Or is that overkill?"

- **Probe:** "Which cuisines would that be most helpful for?"
- **Probe:** "Is this something you'd trust, or would you still ask the waiter?"
- **Listen for:** This is "killer feature" vs "nice to have"

---

**Concept 3: Offline Mode**

"What if the app worked completely offline - you download menu translation packs before your trip, and it works without internet or data?

How important is that to you?"

- **Probe:** "Do you usually have data/wifi when traveling?"
- **Probe:** "Have you been in situations where you didn't have connection?"
- **Listen for:** Critical vs nice-to-have (some users always have WiFi)

---

**Concept 4: Confidence Levels + Reasoning**

"Instead of just saying 'This is vegan,' what if the app showed confidence levels - like 3 dots for 'definitely vegan,' 2 dots for 'probably vegan but ask about [X],' and 1 dot for 'uncertain - needs verification'?

And when you tap on a dish, it explains WHY it rated it that way - like 'Marked vegan because menu says "vegetable broth", but be aware: some restaurants use fish stock. Confirm with server.'

What do you think about that?"

- **Probe:** "Would that make you trust it more or less?"
- **Probe:** "Would you read the reasoning, or just look at the dots?"
- **Listen for:** Trust-building vs information overload

---

**Concept 5: Pre-Visit Planning (Share Extension)**

"What if you could scan menus BEFORE going to a restaurant - like from Google Maps photos or the restaurant website - and save them for later?

Would you do that, or do you prefer deciding in the moment?"

- **Probe:** "How do you usually choose restaurants when traveling?"
- **Listen for:** Planners vs spontaneous travelers (impacts use case)

---

**Open-Ended Feature Question:**

14. **"If you could wave a magic wand and this app did ONE thing perfectly, what would matter most to you?"**
    - Listen for: What they prioritize (speed? accuracy? trust? offline?)
    - Follow-up: "Why that over the other things?"

---

## Part 6: Pricing & Business Model (5 min)

**Goal:** Understand preferences and willingness to pay, not exact price points

**Setup:**
"Now I want to talk about money - I know apps like HappyCow charge around $5-6, Waygo is $6, Vegan Passport is $2. I'm trying to figure out how to price something like this."

15. **"How do you feel about paying for travel apps? Do you usually pay for apps, or prefer free ones?"**
    - Listen for: Willingness to pay at all
    - Probe: "What apps have you paid for while traveling?"

16. **"If this app existed, would you rather:**
    - **Pay once ($5-8) and own it forever?**
    - **Pay monthly ($3-5/month) like a subscription?**
    - **Start free (like 5-10 scans) then pay if you want unlimited?"**

    **Which feels right to you?"**

    - Listen for: Gut reaction, not overthinking
    - Follow-up: "Why that option over the others?"

17. **"When would you decide to get an app like this - before a trip, or when you're already traveling and frustrated?"**
    - Listen for: Purchase trigger (planning vs panic) - impacts model
    - Probe: "Would you want to try it first, or trust reviews?"

18. **"What would make you confident enough to pay for this without trying it first?"**
    - Listen for: Trust-building needs (reviews? Demo video? Free trial?)
    - Listen for: Freemium advantage if they need to "test" it

---

## Part 7: Competitive Alternatives (5 min)

**Goal:** Understand what they're comparing against

19. **"You mentioned using [Google Translate / HappyCow / etc.]. If this new app existed, would you replace those tools or use them alongside?"**
    - Listen for: Switching cost, multi-tool inertia
    - Follow-up: "What would this new app need to do to replace [current tool]?"

20. **"Is there anything your current setup does well that I haven't mentioned?"**
    - Listen for: Gaps in our understanding, features we're missing

---

## Part 8: Wrap-Up & Thank You (2-3 min)

21. **"Is there anything about eating abroad as a vegan/vegetarian that I didn't ask about but should know?"**
    - Open-ended catch-all for surprises

22. **"If I build this, would you want to be notified when it launches? Would you be interested in testing an early version?"**
    - Gauge genuine interest (if they say no, tells you something)
    - Collect email if yes (builds early user list)

**Thank them:**
"This was incredibly helpful - thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. [If offering compensation: I'll send you that Amazon gift card within 24 hours.]"

---

## Post-Interview: Immediate Notes

**Right after the call, capture:**
1. **Overall vibe:** Excited about concept? Lukewarm? Satisfied with current approach?
2. **Strongest pain point for THIS person:** Hidden ingredients? Speed? Trust? None?
3. **Feature excitement ranking:** Which features made them light up vs "meh"?
4. **Pricing preference:** One-time / Subscription / Freemium - and WHY?
5. **Red flags:** Did they say anything that contradicts our assumptions?
6. **Quotes:** Any memorable quotes to document

---

## Analysis Across Interviews

**After 5-10 interviews, look for patterns:**

**Pain Point Validation:**
- How many people experience each pain point? (Frequency)
- How severe is it for them? (Intensity)
- Do some personas feel pain more than others? (Segmentation)

**Feature Prioritization:**
- Which feature(s) got the strongest reaction across interviews?
- Which features are "nice to have" vs "must have"?
- Any features people said they WOULDN'T use?

**Pricing Model Consensus:**
- Is there a clear preference? Or split?
- Does preference correlate with travel frequency? (Frequent travelers → subscription?)
- Does "try before buy" anxiety support freemium?

**Disconfirming Evidence:**
- Did anyone say "I don't have this problem"? (How many?)
- Did anyone say "current tools work fine for me"? (Market size risk)
- Any unexpected objections or concerns?

## Sample Size & Stopping Criteria

**Minimum:** 5 interviews
**Target:** 8-10 interviews
**Stop when:** You hear the same stories/patterns repeatedly (saturation)

**Recruit from:**
- Reddit r/vegan, r/vegetarian, r/vegantravel
- Facebook vegan travel groups
- Personal network (friends who travel)
- Vegan Meetup groups

**Recruitment message example:**
"Hey! I'm researching challenges vegan/vegetarian travelers face with foreign menus (like hidden fish sauce, language barriers, etc.). If you've traveled internationally, I'd love to chat for 30 min about your experiences. Happy to send a $15 Amazon gift card as thanks! DM me if interested."

## Key Differences from Survey Approach

| Survey | Interview |
|--------|-----------|
| Quantitative (numbers) | Qualitative (stories) |
| 50-100 responses | 5-10 deep conversations |
| Test hypotheses | Discover new insights |
| "Which price?" | "Why would you pay?" |
| Structured questions | Conversational flow |
| Data analysis | Pattern recognition |

**Your goal:** Understand the WHY behind behaviors, not just the WHAT.

**Good interview = 70% them talking, 30% you asking/probing**
