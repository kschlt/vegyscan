# Experiment 2: Willingness to Pay Survey

**Status:** ⚪ Not Started
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Owner:** [Your Name]

---

## Hypothesis

**Vegan/vegetarian travelers will pay for a purpose-built menu scanning app at a price point that makes the business viable**

**If this fails:** Business model not viable → STOP or find alternative monetization

---

## Objectives

1. **Validate Pricing Model:** One-time vs Subscription vs Freemium vs Hybrid
2. **Validate Price Point:** Optimal price using Van Westendorp methodology
3. **Validate Market:** US/UK vs Germany vs other markets
4. **Understand User Preferences:** Features, concerns, deal-breakers

**Target Response Rate:** 50-100 responses (more is better)
**Minimum Viable:** 30 responses for directional insights

---

## Method: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

**The 4 Questions:**
1. At what price would this app be **too cheap** (you'd question its quality)?
2. At what price would this app be a **good value** (you'd definitely buy it)?
3. At what price would this app start to seem **expensive** (but you'd still consider it)?
4. At what price would this app be **too expensive** (you wouldn't buy it)?

**Analysis:**
- Plot cumulative distribution curves
- Find "optimal price" = intersection of "expensive" and "good value" curves
- Find "acceptable range" = between "too cheap" and "too expensive"

## Analysis Plan

### 1. Van Westendorp Analysis

**Create 4 cumulative curves:**
1. "Too cheap" (ascending)
2. "Good value" (descending)
3. "Expensive" (ascending)
4. "Too expensive" (descending)

**Find key price points:**
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** Intersection of "expensive" and "good value"
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP):** Intersection of "too cheap" and "too expensive"
- **Acceptable Range:** Between "too cheap" and "too expensive" at 50% cumulative

**Tool:** Excel/Google Sheets with formulas, or online Van Westendorp calculator

---

### 2. Pricing Model Preference

**Calculate:**
- % preferring each model (one-time, subscription, freemium, etc.)
- Segment by market (US vs UK vs DE)
- Segment by travel frequency (frequent vs occasional travelers)

**Decision:** Choose model with highest preference AND best LTV potential

---

### 3. Market Selection

**Analyze by market:**

| Market | Responses | Avg WTP | Model Preference | Travel Frequency | Interest Level |
|--------|-----------|---------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| US | X | $Y | Z | A trips/year | B/5 |
| UK | X | £Y | Z | A trips/year | B/5 |
| DE | X | €Y | Z | A trips/year | B/5 |
| Other | X | $Y | Z | A trips/year | B/5 |

**Decision Factors:**
1. Highest WTP (willingness to pay)
2. Largest addressable market
3. Highest iOS penetration
4. Lowest competitive intensity
5. Easiest organic acquisition

**External Research (supplement survey):**
- iOS penetration by market (Statista, industry reports)
- Competitor intensity (App Store search, reviews)
- Estimated CAC by market (comparable apps, industry benchmarks)

---

- Germans more price-sensitive for apps
- Smaller addressable market

**Data to Validate:**
- Survey: WTP from DE respondents (likely lower than US/UK)
