# User Stories

Agile user stories for VegyScan, grouped by epics.

## Purpose

User stories capture the **value proposition** from the user's perspective. They answer:
- **Who** needs this feature?
- **What** do they want to do?
- **Why** do they want it (what benefit)?

## Format

All stories in [stories.md](./stories.md) follow the standard format:

```
As a [persona],
I want to [action],
so that [benefit].
```

## Relationship to Other Documents

User stories are **complementary** to other business documentation:

- **Personas** ([`../personas.md`](../personas.md)): Define WHO the users are
- **Vision** ([`../vision.md`](../vision.md)): Define WHY we're building VegyScan
- **User Stories** (this file): Define WHAT users want and WHY (value)
- **Requirements** ([`../requirements/`](../requirements/)): Define WHAT features technically
- **Use Cases** ([`../use-cases/`](../use-cases/)): Define HOW users interact (workflows)

### Single Source of Truth

**User stories are the SoT for:**
- User value propositions (why features matter to users)
- Epic organization (thematic grouping of features)

**User stories reference (don't duplicate):**
- Personas → Link to specific personas
- Use cases → Link to detailed workflows
- Requirements → Link to technical specifications

## Links

Each story is linked to:
- **Use Cases** - Detailed interaction flows
- **Requirements** - Technical specifications (REQ-F-* or REQ-NF-*)
