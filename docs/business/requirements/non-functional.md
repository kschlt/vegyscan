## Cost Efficiency

### REQ-NF-013: LLM Cost Optimization

**Description:** System must minimize LLM API costs through aggressive caching, deduplication, smart result retrieval, and on-device processing to make business model viable.

**Rationale:** LLM costs directly impact business model viability. At €8 app price with 30% App Store fee, a user scanning 100 pages on holiday would cost €5 at €0.05/scan, making the business unprofitable. Cost must be dramatically lower.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must Have

**Status:** Draft

**Target:** < €0.01 per 2-page menu scan (€0.005 per page) in LLM costs

**Business Model Analysis:**
- App price: €8.00
- App Store fee (30%): -€2.40
- Available margin: €5.60
- Holiday scenario: 100 pages scanned
- Required cost per page: < €0.005 to remain profitable
- Target total cost for 100-page trip: ~€0.50 (9% of revenue)

**Cost Optimization Strategies (See Functional Requirements):**
- Menu duplicate detection (same restaurant, same menu) → REQ-F-029
- Dish-level caching (same dish across sessions) → REQ-F-030
- Smart result retrieval (image similarity matching) → REQ-F-031
- UX design to minimize re-scans
- On-device processing where possible → REQ-NF-014

**Related:**
- Vision: [Success Criteria - Cost-efficient LLM usage](../vision.md#success-criteria)
- REQ-F-029: Menu Duplicate Detection
- REQ-F-030: Dish-Level Caching
- REQ-F-031: Smart Result Retrieval

---

### REQ-NF-014: On-Device Processing Priority

**Description:** System must maximize on-device processing to reduce cloud API dependency and costs.

**Rationale:** On-device is faster, cheaper, more private. iOS has powerful ML capabilities.

**Priority:** Should Have

**Status:** Draft

---

## Maintainability

### REQ-NF-015: Code Maintainability

**Description:** System must be built with clean architecture and maintainable code for future enhancements.

**Rationale:** App will evolve. v1 architecture must support future features.

**Priority:** Should Have

**Status:** Draft

---

### REQ-NF-016: Future Feature Extensibility

**Description:** System architecture must accommodate planned future features without major refactoring.

**Rationale:** v2+ features (community, cloud sync) deferred from v1 but must be addable without rebuild.

**Priority:** Should Have

**Status:** Draft

**v1 Architectural Guidance:**
- **Community features deferred** (REQ-F-027, REQ-F-028) - OUT of v1 scope
- v1 uses local-only storage, no cloud backend
- **Critical:** Design v1 architecture to be extensible, not rebuildable
- Future cloud features should add new layer, not replace existing architecture
- Data models should accommodate future sync (e.g., local IDs + future cloud IDs)
- Authentication/account system should be addable without UI redesign

**Examples of Extensibility:**
- Local SQLite → Future: Add cloud sync layer on top
- Local-only menus → Future: Add optional cloud sharing
- No accounts → Future: Add optional sign-in for cloud features
- Core functionality works without cloud (offline-first preserved)

**Related:**
- Vision: [Strategic Decisions - Community features OUT of v1](../vision.md#strategic-decisions-and-constraints)
- REQ-F-027: Community-Shared Menu Scans (Future v2+)
- REQ-F-028: User Feedback on Classification (Future v2+)

---

### REQ-NF-017: Icon-Based UI (Minimal Text)

**Description:** System UI must rely primarily on icons, colors, and visual indicators rather than text labels.

**Rationale:** Minimize language barriers, reduce text to translate, create universal design that works across cultures.

**Priority:** Should Have

**Status:** Draft

**v1 Guidance:**
- Vegan/vegetarian classifications use icons (not just text labels)
- Navigation uses iconography where possible
- Color coding for dietary categories (green = vegan, etc.)
- Text only where absolutely necessary for clarity
- Enables easier translation to other languages later (less text = less translation work)

**Related:**
- Vision: [Strategic Decisions - Language/Internationalization](../vision.md#strategic-decisions-and-constraints)

---

### REQ-NF-018: Internationalization (i18n) Support

**Description:** System must use i18n framework for all user-facing text, enabling future translation without code changes.

**Rationale:** v1 launches in English, but architecture must support adding languages (German, French, etc.) without rebuild.

**Priority:** Should Have

**Status:** Draft

**v1 Implementation:**
- English language only for v1 launch
- All UI strings in i18n files (not hardcoded)
- String keys used in code (e.g., `i18n.t('vegan_label')` not `"Vegan"`)
- Date/number formatting locale-aware
- Future: Add German, French translations by updating i18n files only
