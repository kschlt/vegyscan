    description: "Similar to Thai nam pla, this is a staple fermented fish sauce made from anchovies. Ubiquitous in Vietnam - often mixed with lime, sugar, garlic, and chili to create the famous dipping sauce nước chấm."
    why_invisible: "The menu might just say 'fried tofu with tomato sauce,' but that sauce could include fish sauce for saltiness. Unless you specifically ask or the place caters to vegetarians, fish sauce will not be mentioned. Some Vietnamese assume fish sauce is acceptable to vegetarians (since it's not 'meat'). The term 'chay' helps, but you must ensure they know it excludes fish sauce."
    typical_dishes:
      - "Phở (soup broth)"
      - "Bún dishes (noodle bowls)"

      - "Fried rice"
    user_complaints:
      - "Fish sauce is in EVERYTHING, even dipping sauces that look vegetarian"
      - "Even 'vegetable' phở has fish sauce in the broth"
      - "I ordered spring rolls and they were filled only with veggies – but they gave me the usual dipping sauce (fish sauce) without warning"
    real_world_examples:
      - scenario: "Ordered vegetable spring rolls"
        outcome: "Veggie-only filling was fine, but dipping sauce was fish sauce-based nước chấm"
        quote: "Vegan forums recommend always saying 'không nước mắm' (no fish sauce) when ordering anything, even salad or vegetables"
    veganization_tip: "Learn to ask for soy sauce (xì dầu) or salt instead. In tourist spots, some restaurants have vegetarian fish sauce made from soy or pineapple, but don't count on it. Always say 'không nước mắm' (no fish sauce) explicitly."

    description: "Various fermented shrimp or fish condiments. Mắm tôm is a purple fermented shrimp paste (famously used with bún riêu or as a dipping sauce for fried tofu in Hanoi). Mắm ruốc is a fermented krill paste common in central/southern Vietnam."
    why_invisible: "If you don't know the Vietnamese name, you'd never identify these from an English description. They might just call it 'special sauce' or 'flavor paste.' Even locals sometimes forget these count as animal products when advising vegetarians. The broth of 'vegetarian' pho can be suspect if the restaurant isn't purely veg – some travelers have found out the hard way that their pho's depth came from a sneaky shrimp paste or meat bone addition."
    typical_dishes:
      - "Bún bò Huế (spicy Huế noodle soup - has fermented crab/shrimp paste)"
      - "Bún riêu (tomato crab noodle soup)"
      - "Regional veggie dishes (central Vietnam)"
      - "Dipping sauces (for grilled rice paper rolls)"
      - "Some pho broth (not always, but possible)"
    user_complaints:
      - "Ordered 'vegetarian' pho and found out broth had shrimp paste"
      - "Super pungent sauce with tofu turned out to be shrimp paste-based"
    modification_feasibility: "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Pre-made into paste
    veganization_tip: "Stick to eateries explicitly advertising 'phở chay' or 'đồ chay' where they know to omit these. If you smell something fishy or overly funky in a dish that should be just veggies, inquire – it could be hidden mắm."

    description: "Beef, chicken, or pork stock used in soups, stews, and even to cook certain rice dishes. Vietnam is famous for soup noodles, and the richness usually comes from long-simmered bones. Unfortunately, some places will serve 'vegetarian' versions but still use the same broth minus the meat pieces."
    why_invisible: "Broth is entirely behind the scenes. Menu names like 'Pho rau' (vegetable pho) or 'canh chay' (veg soup) might lull you into security, but unless the place specializes in chay cuisine, ask how the broth is made. In Vietnamese, nước dùng means broth. Many locals simply don't consider stock as 'meat' in the dish's name."

    user_complaints:
      - "Ordered 'vegetarian pho' at normal phở shop, verified broth - some smaller shops use beef/chicken broth by default (no separate pot)"
      - "Suspected local 'vegan phở' broth was still made with beef and shrimp, just without the meat garnishes"
    real_world_examples:
      - scenario: "Ordered vegetarian pho at regular pho shop"
        outcome: "Small shop only had one pot of broth (beef), just didn't add meat slices"

    modification_feasibility: "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Broth cooked for hours, can't remake
    veganization_tip: "Use the phrase 'không dùng nước dùng thịt' (don't use meat broth) when ordering soups or rice. Or seek Buddhist-run restaurants where all broths are plant-based by philosophy."

    notes: |
      - Buddhist vegetarian tradition (ăn chay) well-established in Vietnam
      - "Chay" means vegetarian for religious purposes (usually vegan)
      - Many Vietnamese practice vegetarian diet on full moon and new moon days
      - However, in regular restaurants, fish sauce is so fundamental they may not consider it "meat"
      - "Vegan" as Western concept less understood outside cities

    effective_terminology:
      best: "Ăn chay - Buddhist vegetarian"
      good: "Không ăn thịt, cá, trứng, sữa - No meat, fish, eggs, dairy"

    notes: |
      Vietnamese cuisine can be flexible, especially street food.
      However, fish sauce and broths are so fundamental that substitutions
      can be challenging. Success depends on whether they're cooking to order
      vs. using pre-made components.
