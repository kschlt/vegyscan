      best: "Ăn chay - Buddhist vegetarian"
      good: "Không ăn thịt, cá, trứng, sữa - No meat, fish, eggs, dairy"

      Vietnamese cuisine can be flexible, especially street food.
      However, fish sauce and broths are so fundamental that substitutions
      can be challenging. Success depends on whether they're cooking to order
      vs. using pre-made components.
