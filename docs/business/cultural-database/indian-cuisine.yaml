  name: "Indian"

  problem_intensity: "MEDIUM"
  problem_frequency: "30-40% of dishes contain ghee, paneer, yogurt, or cream"

  problem_description: |
    Indian cuisine has many vegetarian options (due to Hindu/Jain traditions),
    but vegetarian does NOT mean vegan. Ghee (clarified butter) is used
    extensively in cooking. Paneer (cheese), yogurt, and cream are common
    in curries and breads. However, India has more naturally vegan options
    than most cuisines - dal (lentils), many vegetable curries, rice, and
    some breads are vegan. South Indian cuisine tends to be more vegan-friendly
    than North Indian.

  ocr_difficulty: "VERY_HIGH"
  ocr_notes: |
    - Multiple scripts: Devanagari (Hindi), Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, etc.
    - No cognates with English for most dishes
    - Many regional languages and scripts
    - English menus common in tourist areas and cities
    - Romanization helps but inconsistent spelling

regional_variations:
  - region: "South India (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh)"
    vegan_friendliness: "HIGH"
    notes: |
      South Indian cuisine is MORE vegan-friendly. Uses coconut oil
      instead of ghee in many dishes. Dosa, idli, sambar, coconut
      chutney are often naturally vegan.

  - region: "North India (Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan)"
    vegan_friendliness: "LOW_TO_MEDIUM"
    notes: |
      North Indian cuisine is DAIRY-HEAVY. Ghee, paneer, cream, yogurt
      are fundamental ingredients. Modification usually needed.

      - "Naan (with ghee/yogurt)"

# MODIFICATION CULTURE

modification_culture:
  overall_acceptance: "HIGH"
  overall_notes: |
    India has HIGH modification acceptance, especially for dietary/
    religious reasons. Indians understand vegetarianism deeply (though
    not always veganism). Asking for no ghee/dairy is usually respected.

    - type: "Vegetarian restaurants (Pure Veg)"
      acceptance_rate: 80  # 75-85%
      success_factors:

        - "Used to Jain requests (no onion/garlic)"
        - "Understand religious dietary needs"
      limitations:
        - "Vegetarian does NOT mean vegan - dairy is common"
        - "Ghee is standard - must ask for oil"
      approach: |
        Very receptive to dietary requests. Say you're "pure vegan"
        or "no dairy" and they'll usually accommodate.

    - type: "Non-vegetarian restaurants"
      acceptance_rate: 60  # 50-70%
      success_factors:
        - "Still understand vegetarian requests"

      approach: "Ask for vegetarian + no dairy"

    - type: "South Indian restaurants"
      acceptance_rate: 85  # 80-90%
      success_factors:
        - "Many dishes naturally vegan"
        - "Use coconut oil more than ghee"
      approach: "Ask if dish contains ghee or dairy"

    - type: "Street food"
      acceptance_rate: 65  # 60-70%
      limitations:
        - "Pre-made items hard to modify"
        - "Shared cooking surfaces with ghee"
      approach: "Ask ingredients, choose items less likely to have dairy"

  critical_warnings:
    - "VEGETARIAN ≠ VEGAN in India - dairy is everywhere in vegetarian food"
    - "Ghee is the default cooking fat - ALWAYS ask if oil can be used instead"
    - "Don't assume 'Pure Veg' means vegan - it means no meat/fish/eggs, but dairy is included"
    - "South Indian cuisine is generally more vegan-friendly than North Indian"

# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================

recommendations:
  strategy: |
    India is MEDIUM difficulty for vegans - lots of vegetarian options,
    but vegetarian ≠ vegan. Ghee is everywhere.

    **Best Strategy:**
    1. Always specify "no ghee, no dairy" - don't rely on "vegetarian"
    2. South Indian restaurants are more vegan-friendly
    3. Ask for oil instead of ghee
    4. Jain restaurants (no onion/garlic) may be more accommodating
    5. Avoid North Indian rich curries (cream/paneer heavy)

    **Key phrases:**
    - "No ghee, only oil"
    - "No paneer, no yogurt, no cream"
    - "Pure vegan, no dairy"
