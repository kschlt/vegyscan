  name: "Korean"

  problem_intensity: "MEDIUM_HIGH"
  problem_frequency: "50-60% of dishes contain fish sauce, anchovy broth, or animal products"

  problem_description: |
    Korean cuisine has hidden animal products in many seemingly vegetarian
    dishes. Kimchi (fermented vegetables) almost always contains fish sauce
    or shrimp paste. Gochujang (red pepper paste) may contain anchovy.
    Many broths use anchovy or beef stock. However, Korea has a Buddhist
    vegetarian tradition (사찰음식 - sachal eumsik / temple food), so
    some vegan options exist.

  # FISH/SEAFOOD - CRITICAL
  - name: "Fish sauce & fermented shrimp in kimchi (Jeotgal)"
    name_local: "젓갈 (액젓/새우젓)"
    transliteration: "jeot-gal (aekjeot/saeujeot)"
    frequency: "VERY_HIGH"  # 85%+ of kimchi
    frequency_rating: 5  # 1-5 scale (nearly universal in kimchi)
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    severity_rating: 3  # 1-3 scale (fish/shellfish content)
    typical_dishes:
      - "Kimchi (김치) - cabbage, radish, cucumber"
      - "Kimchi jjigae (김치찌개 - kimchi stew)"
      - "Kimchi bokkeumbap (김치볶음밥 - kimchi fried rice)"
      - "Other banchan (side dishes) - seasoned soybean sprouts, spinach, radish"
      - "Any dish with kimchi"
    why_invisible: "Kimchi looks like just cabbage and chili, so new veg travelers happily munch it until they learn the recipe. It's rarely listed as containing fish on menus because it's assumed knowledge in Korea. Similarly, the small dishes of seasoned veggies don't list ingredients – you'd have to ask the chef. Many Koreans consider kimchi and these condiments as 'vegetables,' forgetting the little bit of seafood in the seasoning."
    user_complaints:
      - "I ordered something with no meat and still got kimchi on the side (fishy) and realized the soup base had anchovy"
      - "Some Korean Buddhists eat kimchi with fish sauce because they consider the amounts medicinal or negligible"
    real_world_examples:
      - scenario: "Ordered tofu stew 'with no meat'"
        outcome: "Got kimchi as banchan (side dish), which contained fish sauce"
        note: "Kimchi is served automatically with most meals"
    modification_feasibility: "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Already fermented with it
    modification_notes: "Kimchi is pre-made and fermented with fish sauce (액젓 aekjeot) or tiny salted shrimp (새우젓 saeujeot) - cannot be removed after fermentation. These are core ingredients for kimchi."
    questions_to_ask:
      - "김치에 액젓이나 새우젓이 들어갔나요?" (Does the kimchi contain fish sauce or shrimp paste?)
      - "채식 김치 있나요?" (Do you have vegetarian kimchi?)
    veganization_tip: "Look for or ask for 'Bibim-kimchi' or 'vegetarian kimchi' (채식 김치), which some restaurants might have (made with dried shiitake or kelp stock instead). Use the word '나는 채식주의자라서 젓갈 들어간 건 못 먹어요' (I'm vegetarian, so I can't eat things with fermented fish/shrimp). There are increasing places offering 'vegan kimchi', but standard restaurants won't."
    description: |
      Jeotgal (젓갈) refers to salted, fermented seafood like fish sauce (액젓 aekjeot)
      or tiny salted shrimp (새우젓 saeujeot). These are core ingredients in making kimchi,
      the famous spicy fermented cabbage, as well as other fermented pastes. Virtually all
      traditional kimchi (cabbage, radish, cucumber) is made with either fish sauce or tiny
      shrimp for fermentation. Many other banchan (side dishes) also use fish sauce for
      seasoning – e.g., seasoned soybean sprouts, some spinach or radish salads.

  overall_notes: |
    Korea has moderate modification acceptance. Street food and
    casual restaurants are usually flexible. Traditional restaurants
    may be less accommodating. Buddhist temple food restaurants are
    completely vegan-friendly.

    - type: "Temple food restaurants (사찰음식)"
      acceptance_rate: 100  # Everything is vegan
      notes: "Specifically vegan - no modifications needed"

    - type: "Casual restaurants / Street food"
      acceptance_rate: 65  # 60-70%

      approach: "Polite but expect limited options"

    - type: "Modern / Fusion restaurants"
      acceptance_rate: 70  # 65-75%
      success_factors:
        - "More international awareness"
        - "Seoul/Busan have growing vegan scene"
      approach: "Direct requests usually work well"

# ============================================================================
# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================

recommendations:
  strategy: |
    Korea is MEDIUM-HIGH difficulty for vegans, primarily because of
    hidden fish sauce/shrimp paste in kimchi and anchovy broth in soups.

    **Best Strategy:**
    1. Find temple food (사찰음식) restaurants - 100% vegan
    2. Ask specifically about fish sauce/shrimp paste in kimchi
    3. Ask about broth base (vegetable vs. anchovy/beef)
    4. Seoul has growing vegan scene - use HappyCow

    **When to give up:**
    - If kimchi is only option and contains fish sauce
    - If all soups/stews use anchovy broth
    - Better to find temple food restaurant

    **Key insight:**
    Don't assume kimchi or "vegetable" dishes are vegan - always ask
    about fish sauce, shrimp paste, and anchovy broth.
