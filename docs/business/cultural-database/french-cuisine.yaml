  name: "French"
  name_local: "Cuisine française"
  problem_intensity: "MEDIUM_HIGH"
  problem_frequency: "50-60% of dishes contain butter, cream, cheese, or eggs"

  problem_description: |
    French cuisine is heavily dairy-based - butter, cream, and cheese
    are foundational ingredients. Even seemingly vegan dishes often
    contain butter or cream. Modification acceptance is VERY LOW -
    traditional French chefs view recipes as art and resist changes.

  ocr_difficulty: "MEDIUM"
  ocr_notes: |
    - Standard Latin alphabet (same as English)
    - Accent marks (é, è, ê, ç) usually not critical for OCR
    - Challenges: Handwritten menus in traditional restaurants
    - Menu terminology uses many French-specific culinary terms

# MODIFICATION CULTURE
# ============================================================================

modification_culture:
  overall_acceptance: "VERY_LOW"
  overall_notes: |
    French cuisine is renowned for tradition and chef artistry.
    Modifications are often seen as disrespectful or insulting to
    the chef's vision. Expect resistance, especially in traditional
    or high-end restaurants.

  by_restaurant_type:
    - type: "Traditional French (bistros, brasseries, haute cuisine)"
      acceptance_rate: 15  # 10-20%
      success_factors:
        - "High-end restaurants with accommodating chefs (rare)"
        - "Tourist-friendly restaurants in Paris"
      limitations:
        - "Chef may refuse modifications entirely"
        - "Modifications seen as insulting to culinary tradition"
        - "Menu is considered fixed art"
      approach: |
        Be extremely polite and apologetic. Expect "non" (no).
        If chef refuses, respect the answer - don't push.
        Better strategy: Find vegan restaurant instead.

    - type: "Modern/Casual restaurants"
      acceptance_rate: 40  # 30-50%
      success_factors:
        - "Younger chefs more flexible"
        - "Casual atmosphere"
        - "Tourist areas with international clientele"
      approach: |
        Still be very polite, but chances are better here.
        Ask if modifications are possible before ordering.

    - type: "Cafés"
      acceptance_rate: 50  # 40-60%
      success_factors:
        - "Simple dishes easier to modify"
        - "Salads can be customized"
      approach: "Direct but polite"

  critical_warnings:
    - "France has one of the LOWEST modification acceptance rates globally"
    - "Traditional chefs view recipes as sacred - modifications = disrespect"
    - "Even simple requests (no butter, no cheese) may be refused"
    - "Better strategy: Find vegan-friendly restaurant or order obviously vegan items"
    - "Don't expect the same flexibility as in UK/US"

      - "Apologize for the inconvenience: 'Je suis désolé(e)' (I'm sorry)"

  language_expectations:
    paris_tourist_areas:
      english_proficiency: "MEDIUM_TO_HIGH"
      notes: |
        Paris restaurants in tourist areas (Marais, Latin Quarter,
        near Eiffel Tower) usually have English-speaking staff.
        However, speaking French is still appreciated.

    rural_france:
      english_proficiency: "LOW_TO_MEDIUM"
      notes: |
        Outside major cities, English proficiency drops significantly.
        French phrases essential. Many servers won't speak English.

    french_attitude:
      notes: |
        French culture values effort - attempting to speak French
        (even badly) is appreciated. Starting in English without
        trying French may be seen as rude.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================

recommendations:
  strategy: |
    France is one of the MOST CHALLENGING countries for vegan dining.

    **Best Strategy:**
    1. Find vegan-specific restaurants (Paris has many)
    2. Use HappyCow to locate vegan-friendly places
    3. At traditional restaurants: Order obviously vegan items only
       (salads without cheese/eggs, fruit, bread)
    4. Don't expect modifications - chefs will likely refuse

    **When to give up:**
    - If restaurant has no obviously vegan items
    - If chef refuses modifications (respect and leave)
    - If menu is entirely dairy/meat-based

    **Better approach:**
    Research vegan restaurants before dining. Paris, Lyon, Nice,
    Marseille all have dedicated vegan options.
