# Cultural Notes
cultural_context:
  vegetarian_concept:
    understanding_level: "MODERATE"
    notes: |
      - Buddhist vegetarian tradition (素食 / sù shí) well-established in China
      - "素" (sù) means vegetarian, BUT interpretation varies:
        - At Buddhist vegetarian restaurants: Strictly no animal products, no onion/garlic
        - At regular restaurants: May just mean "no visible meat" - can include oyster sauce, eggs, dairy
      - Many Chinese vegetarians accept oyster sauce as "vegetarian" (cultural norm)
      - "Vegan" (纯素 / chúnsù or 严格素食 / yángé sù shí) is newer concept, understood in cities

    effective_terminology:
      best: "全素，不吃蛋奶蚝油 (quán sù, bù chī dàn nǎi háoyóu) - Fully vegetarian, no eggs, dairy, oyster sauce"
      good: "素食 (sù shí) - vegetarian (but clarify no oyster sauce)"
      avoid: Just saying "vegetarian" without specifics - may get oyster sauce

  buddhist_vegetarian:
    concept: "素食 (sù shí)"
    strict_definition: "No meat, fish, eggs, dairy, onion, garlic (五辛 / wǔ xīn - five pungent spices)"
    where_to_find:
      - "Buddhist temples (寺庙 / sìmiào)"
      - "Vegetarian restaurants (素食餐厅 / sù shí cāntīng)"
      - "Some health food restaurants"

  modification_culture:
    overall_acceptance: "MODERATE"
    notes: |
      Chinese restaurants can be flexible, especially if you're ordering and paying.
      However, many dishes use pre-made sauces or are cooked in bulk, limiting modification.
      Success depends heavily on restaurant type and whether they cook to order.

    by_restaurant_type:
      - type: "Buddhist vegetarian restaurants"
        acceptance_rate: 95  # Already all vegan/vegetarian

        acceptance_rate: 60  # 55-65%
        success_factors:
          - "Cook to order"
          - "Can adjust seasonings if asked"
        limitations:
          - "May use pre-made sauces with oyster sauce"
          - "Lard may be default cooking fat"

        - "Emphasize: 全素 (quán sù) - fully vegetarian"
        - "In tourist areas, some English understood. Elsewhere, minimal."
