# Cultural Notes
cultural_context:
  vegetarian_concept:
    understanding_level: "MODERATE"
    notes: |
      - "Vegetarian" is understood but may include fish sauce (fish not seen as "meat")
      - "Vegan" (วีแกน / wee-gan) is growing in awareness, especially in cities
      - Buddhist concept of "เจ" (jay) is well understood = strict vegan (no animal products, no onion/garlic)
    effective_terminology:
      best: "เจ (jay) - Buddhist vegan"
      good: "มังสวิรัติ (mang-sa-wi-rat) - vegetarian"
      okay: "วีแกน (wee-gan) - vegan (loanword)"
