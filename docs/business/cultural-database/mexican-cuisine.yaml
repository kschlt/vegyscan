  problem_description: |
    Mexican cuisine has hidden animal products in seemingly vegetarian
    dishes. Lard (pork fat) is traditionally used in refried beans,
    tamales, and tortillas. Chicken or beef stock is used in rice and
    beans. Cheese and crema (Mexican sour cream) are common toppings.
    However, many dishes can be modified, and there are naturally
    vegan options (guacamole, salsa, black beans without lard).

  ocr_difficulty: "LOW"
  ocr_notes: |
    - Spanish language - Latin alphabet (same as English)
    - Many cognates and familiar words
    - Accent marks (á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ) usually not critical for understanding
    - OCR generally accurate for Spanish text

# ============================================================================
# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================

recommendations:
  strategy: |
    Mexico is MEDIUM difficulty for vegans. Hidden lard is the main
    challenge, but modifications are usually well-accepted.

    **Best Strategy:**
    1. Always ask about lard in beans, rice, tortillas
    2. Stick to corn tortillas (safer than flour)
    3. Ask for no cheese, no crema (easy to remove)
    4. Guacamole, salsa, chips are safe bets
    5. Chain restaurants often use vegetable oil (more cost-effective than lard)

    **Key Questions:**
    - "¿Los frijoles tienen manteca?" (Do beans have lard?)
    - "¿El arroz tiene caldo de pollo?" (Does rice have chicken stock?)
    - "Sin queso, sin crema" (No cheese, no cream)
