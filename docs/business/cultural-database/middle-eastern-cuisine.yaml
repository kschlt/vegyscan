  problem_frequency: "25-35% of dishes contain yogurt, butter, or meat"

  problem_description: |
    Middle Eastern cuisine has MANY naturally vegan options - hummus,
    falafel, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, muhammara, and many vegetable
    mezze are traditionally vegan. However, yogurt is used in some
    dishes (labneh, some sauces), butter/ghee in rice pilaf and
    pastries, and honey in desserts. The mezze (small plates) style
    makes it easy to select vegan items.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
# ============================================================================

recommendations:
  strategy: |
    Middle Eastern cuisine is one of the EASIEST for vegans.
    Hummus, falafel, baba ganoush, and many mezze are naturally vegan.

    **Best Strategy:**
    1. Order mezze platter - select vegan items:
       - Hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, tabbouleh,
         fattoush, muhammara, stuffed grape leaves
    2. Avoid: labneh (yogurt), halloumi (cheese), meat dishes
    3. Ask about yogurt in sauces (use tahini instead)
    4. Baklava usually has butter - skip desserts or ask

    **Easiest Vegan Meal:**
    Falafel wrap with hummus, tabbouleh, pickles, tahini sauce.
    Almost universally available and vegan.
