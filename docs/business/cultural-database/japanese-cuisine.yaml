      Miso soup ALMOST ALWAYS contains dashi (fish stock). Even if it looks like
      just miso paste and tofu, the broth is dashi. Only vegan restaurants or
      temple cuisine (shojin ryori) make miso soup with kombu (kelp) dashi only.

# Cultural Notes
cultural_context:
  vegetarian_concept:
    understanding_level: "VERY_LOW"
    notes: |
      - "Vegetarian" (ベジタリアン / bejitarian) not widely understood
      - Fish and fish stock NOT considered "meat" by many Japanese
      - May be offered fish even after saying "no meat"
      - "Vegan" (ヴィーガン / vīgan) is even less familiar (mostly unknown outside major cities)
      - Buddhist concept of "shojin" (精進) is understood = temple food, no animal products

    effective_terminology:
      best: "精進料理 (shōjin ryōri) - Buddhist temple food (no animal products)"
      good: "Detailed explanation: I cannot eat meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or fish stock"
      avoid: Just saying "vegetarian" or "vegan" - likely to be misunderstood

    explanation_phrase:
      english: "I cannot eat meat, fish, seafood, dairy, eggs, or fish stock (dashi)"
      japanese: "肉、魚、魚介類、乳製品、卵、魚のだし（出汁）が食べられません"
      transliteration: "Niku, sakana, gyokairui, nyūseihin, tamago, sakana no dashi ga taberaremasen"

      transliteration_short: "Niku mo sakana mo tamago mo nyūseihin mo dashi mo taberaremasen"

  modification_culture:
    overall_acceptance: "VERY_LOW"
    notes: |
      Traditional Japanese cuisine emphasizes perfection and the chef's intent.
      Modifying dishes is often seen as disrespectful or questioning the chef's skill.
      Restaurants rarely accommodate special requests, especially outside major cities.

      CRITICAL CULTURAL NOTE: Don't push for modifications in traditional settings.
      It's better to choose a naturally vegan dish or find a vegan-friendly restaurant.
