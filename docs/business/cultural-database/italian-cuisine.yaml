# Cultural Notes
cultural_context:
  vegetarian_concept:
    understanding_level: "MODERATE_TO_HIGH"
    notes: |
      - "Vegetariano" understood, but interpretation varies
      - Many Italians consider Parmesan "vegetarian" (unaware of rennet)
      - "Vegano" (vegan) increasingly understood in cities, less in rural areas
      - Italian cuisine has many naturally vegan staples (pasta, bread, vegetables)
      - Traditional approach: food is regional and seasonal - modifications less common

    effective_terminology:
      best: "Vegano - no carne, pesce, latticini, uova, formaggio"
      good: "Vegetariano - plus explain: no cheese, no eggs, no dairy"
      clarify: "Senza formaggio, senza burro (without cheese, without butter)"

  modification_culture:
    overall_acceptance: "MODERATE"
    notes: |
      Italians are proud of traditional cuisine. Modifications can be seen as
      disrespectful to the dish. However, simpler dishes (pasta with tomato sauce)
      are easier to modify. Fine dining less flexible than casual trattorias.
