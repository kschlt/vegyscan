## Scope

This domain contains ALL business-related artifacts from the user perspective.

**Belongs here:**
- ✅ User problems and needs
- ✅ Feature descriptions (WHAT, not HOW)
- ✅ Functional requirements
- ✅ Non-functional requirements (performance, UX, accessibility)
- ✅ Use cases and user stories

**Does NOT belong here:**
- ❌ Technology choices (→ `architecture/`)
- ❌ Implementation details (→ code)
- ❌ System architecture (→ `architecture/diagrams/`)

## File Responsibilities (Single Source of Truth)

### `vision.md`
**SoT for:**
- Overall product vision
- Business goals
- Scope boundaries (what's IN and OUT)
- Success criteria

**Update when:**
- Product direction changes
- New strategic goals emerge
- Scope needs clarification

**Never include:**
- Specific features (those go in use-cases/)
- Technical decisions (→ architecture/)

### `personas.md`
**SoT for:**
- User types and demographics
- User motivations and pain points
- Usage contexts

**Update when:**
- New user research reveals different personas
- User needs change

**Never include:**
- Specific features (→ use-cases/)
- UI/UX implementation (→ requirements/non-functional.md)

### `use-cases/`
**SoT for:**
- Individual use case flows
- Actors, preconditions, postconditions
- Success and failure scenarios

**See:** `use-cases/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

### `user-stories/`
**SoT for:**
- Agile user stories with acceptance criteria
- Epic grouping

**See:** `user-stories/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

### `requirements/`
**SoT for:**
- Functional requirements (what the system must do)
- Non-functional requirements (how well it must do it)

**See:** `requirements/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

## Cross-References

When information relates to multiple documents:
1. Write full content in SoT file
2. Link to it from other files with context
3. Never copy/paste information

**Example:**
In use-case: "Actor: Health-conscious consumer (see [personas.md](../personas.md#health-conscious))"

## Update Priority

When new business information arrives:
1. Update `vision.md` if it affects overall direction
2. Update `personas.md` if it reveals new user insights
3. Create/update use-case in `use-cases/`
4. Extract requirements to `requirements/functional.md`
5. Link everything appropriately
