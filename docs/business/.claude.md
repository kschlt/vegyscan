# Business Domain - AI Instructions

## Scope

This domain contains ALL business-related artifacts from the user perspective.

**Belongs here:**
- ✅ User problems and needs
- ✅ Feature descriptions (WHAT, not HOW)
- ✅ Functional requirements
- ✅ Non-functional requirements (performance, UX, accessibility)
- ✅ Use cases and user stories

**Does NOT belong here:**
- ❌ Technology choices (→ `architecture/`)
- ❌ Implementation details (→ code)
- ❌ System architecture (→ `architecture/diagrams/`)

## File Responsibilities (Single Source of Truth)

### `vision.md`
**SoT for:**
- WHY we're building this (problem statement, vision statement)
- High-level goals (outcomes, not features)
- Strategic boundaries (what we're NOT building and WHY)
- Success criteria (outcomes, not feature lists)

**Update when:**
- Product direction changes
- Strategic goals shift
- Target user understanding changes

**NEVER include:**
- ❌ Detailed feature lists (those go in requirements/functional.md)
- ❌ Specific implementation details (→ architecture/)
- ❌ "Core Features" or "Bonus Features" lists (→ requirements/functional.md)

**CRITICAL:** If you add a new feature, update `requirements/functional.md` ONLY, not vision.md

### `personas.md`
**SoT for:**
- User types and demographics
- User motivations and pain points
- Usage contexts

**Update when:**
- New user research reveals different personas
- User needs change

**Never include:**
- Specific features (→ use-cases/)
- UI/UX implementation (→ requirements/non-functional.md)

### `use-cases/`
**SoT for:**
- Individual use case flows
- Actors, preconditions, postconditions
- Success and failure scenarios

**See:** `use-cases/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

### `user-stories/`
**SoT for:**
- Agile user stories with acceptance criteria
- Epic grouping

**See:** `user-stories/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

### `requirements/functional.md`
**SoT for:**
- **ALL features** (core + bonus + future)
- WHAT the system must do (detailed specifications)
- Feature descriptions with acceptance criteria
- Priority levels (Must Have, Should Have, Nice to Have)

**Update when:**
- New features are identified
- Existing features need refinement
- Priorities change

**CRITICAL:** This is the ONLY place where detailed features are documented
- If you add a feature, add it here as a requirement (REQ-F-XXX)
- Do NOT add feature lists to vision.md

### `requirements/non-functional.md`
**SoT for:**
- Quality attributes (performance, usability, reliability, cost)
- Constraints (platform, technology, business)
- HOW WELL the system must perform

**See:** `requirements/.claude.md` for detailed instructions

## Cross-References

When information relates to multiple documents:
1. Write full content in SoT file
2. Link to it from other files with context
3. Never copy/paste information

**Example:**
In use-case: "Actor: Health-conscious consumer (see [personas.md](../personas.md#health-conscious))"

## Update Priority

When new business information arrives:
1. Update `vision.md` if it affects overall direction
2. Update `personas.md` if it reveals new user insights
3. Create/update use-case in `use-cases/`
4. Extract requirements to `requirements/functional.md`
5. Link everything appropriately
